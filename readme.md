# Darmankade

Internet Engineering BSc Project at Amirkabir University of Technology Fall 99
This project is a right of the bat rip-off of [Darmankade](https://www.darmankade.com/) which I guess we single handedly boost up its' page rank a lot just by checking it every day.
Also it's worth noting that the front part was a pain in the ass.

## Phase 1 : Front

### Part 1 : HTML CSS
Only main page (index.html) and login page (login.html) were "implemented" in this part, but the point is there were no frameworks like bootstrap, so it was more like torture with extra steps. It was like chewing newspapers.

### Part 2 : Bootstrap but not responsive
In this part, 3 more pages were added to finish up the front part. The main functionality of front-end was the doctors page. We were allowed to use Bootsrrap but what did it cost? Everything. Imagine chewing a newspapers with water, It won't make it better.
Also I have to mention that, please don't resize your window, you'll regret it.

## Phase 2 : Interactions and Dynamic Content

This phase was surprisingly easy. Some interactions like functional filters were added  using javascript and doctors pages (doctors-list.html and doctors-personal-page.html) were dynamically filled with api and vue.js
